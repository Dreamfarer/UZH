Input: An array A[1..n] with n distinct integers, where n â‰¥ 2. 
Output: the second largest integer in A

largest_number = very small number
second_number = very small number


for i from A[0 until end]

	if i > largest_number
		second_number = largest_number
		largest_number = i

	else if i > second_number
		second_number = i

return second_number
