Input: An array A[1..n] with n distinct integers, where n â‰¥ 2. 
Output: the second largest integer in A

# maybe replace this part with two very small numbers for largest_number and second_number #
if A[0] > A[1]
	largest_number = A[0] and second_number = A[1]
else 
	largest_number = A[1] and second_number = A[0]
#															 #

for i from A[2 until end]

	if i > largest_number
		second_number = largest_number
		largest_number = i

	else if i > second_number
		second_number = i

return second_number
