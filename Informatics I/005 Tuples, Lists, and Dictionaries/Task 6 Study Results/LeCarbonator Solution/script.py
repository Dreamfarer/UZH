# File doesn't work for you?
# This task requires the relative path to your file. However, depending on your
# IDE, that path may differ. It's not (always) relative to the python file, but instead
# to the top directory of your project.
#
# Don't know where to find that?
# execute the command
#   print(os.getcwd())
# cwd stands for "current working directory", and it will display from where
# you execute python files. Your relative file must point from there.
# this example assumes you have "UZH" as the highest folder. So we must
# work our way down the folders to reach the txt file.
