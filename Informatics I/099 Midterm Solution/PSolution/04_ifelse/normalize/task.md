Implement a function `normalize` which takes three numbers as parameters `number`, `lower` and `upper`. If `number` is smaller than `lower`, the function should return `lower`. If `number` is larger than `upper`, it should return `upper`. Otherwise, the function should return `number`.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
