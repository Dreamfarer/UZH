Implement a function `multiply` which takes a number as parameter `n` and, optionally, another number as parameter `factor`, which shall be `1` by default. The function should return `n` multiplied by `factor`.

**Important**: In this task, you must write the function signature yourself. Make sure that your function is called `multiply`.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
