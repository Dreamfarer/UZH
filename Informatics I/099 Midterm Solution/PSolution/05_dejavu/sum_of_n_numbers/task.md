Implement a function `sum_divisibles` which takes two parameters, a positive integer `divisor` and a non-negative integer `limit`. The function should compute the sum of all values from `0` up to and including `limit` which are divisible by `divisor`.

For example, given a `limit` of `17` and a `divisor` of `4`, the return value should be `40` (which results from `4 + 8 + 12 + 16`).

You may assume that your function will only be called with non-negative integers.
