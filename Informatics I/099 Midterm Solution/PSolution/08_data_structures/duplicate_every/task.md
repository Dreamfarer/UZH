Implement a function `duplicate_every` which takes two parameters: a list `l` and a positive integer `n`. The function should return a list containing the elements from `l` but with every `n`'th element occuring twice. For example, if `n` is 3, every third element should be repeated once.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
