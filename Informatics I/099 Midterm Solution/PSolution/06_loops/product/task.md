Implement a function `product` which takes two lists of numbers as parameters `xs` and `ys`. For every value *x* in `xs`, the function should multiply *x* with every value in `ys` and print each result, one per line. Note that this function does not return anything.

Important: even though there are various ways to solve this task, you **must** use at least one `for` loop to solve this problem and you may not use `range()`. 

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
