The first program a developer writes in a new language is typically a "hello world" program to
see a first output on the screen. In this task, you will create a more advanced version that can generate
a more complex greeting.

Given the two variables `name` and `age`, write a program that will generate a personalized greeting. For example,
for `"Hans"` and `37`, the program should generate the string `"Hello Hans, you are 37 years old!"`.

Implement it in a function `generate_greeting` where it should be returned.

Please make sure that your solution is self-contained within the `generate_greeting` function. In other words, only change the body of the function, not the code outside the function.
