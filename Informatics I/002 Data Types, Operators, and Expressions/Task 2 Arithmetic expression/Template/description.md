Transform the following mathematical expression into a Python program to be able to calculate the
result for arbitrary values of a, b, c, and d defined in the source code:

`a - (b^2 / (c - d * (a + b)))`

Implement it in a function `calculate` where it should be returned.

Please make sure that your solution is self-contained within the `calculate` function. In other words, only change the body of the function, not the code outside the function.
