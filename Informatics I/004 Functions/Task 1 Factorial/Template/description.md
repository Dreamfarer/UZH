In mathematics, the factorial `n!` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`:

    n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1

Write a function `fac` that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial. For example, `fac(5)` is `120`, `fac(0)` is defined as `1`. You do not have to handle any negative numbers.

**Note:** Starting with this exercise, we will provide public tests that *fail* by default. The tests we provide will *pass* for a correct solution, but keep in mind that the grading system runs many more exhaustive tests, so if the public test passes, that does not necessarily mean that your solution is 100% correct, as it might fail on certain edge or corner cases.

**Note:** The provided script defines the signature of the functions. Do not change this signature or the automated grading will fail.

**Note:** This task, like any, can be solved both sequentially or recursively. Both solutions are fine and you only need to provide one of them. Try to create the other version of the program for yourself as additional exercise!
