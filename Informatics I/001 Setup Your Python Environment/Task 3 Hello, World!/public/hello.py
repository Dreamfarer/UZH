# This is "source code". It's plain text and you can edit with
# any text editor However, don't attempt to use a rich-text
# editor such as Microsoft Word! Comments, such as these lines,
# are ignored in Python if they start with an octothorpe (#)

# On this next line, we're using Python's 'print' function
# to print a line of text:
print("Hello, World!")

# A function often receives "arguments", which are the things
# contained within the (parantheses). In this case, the print
# function receives exactly one argument, which is a so-called
# "String". Strings are pieces of text and in Python, they are
# surrounded by quotation marks ("")
